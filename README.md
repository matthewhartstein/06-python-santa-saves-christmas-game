The Best Game Ever: Santa Saves Christmas!

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: Pygame, Pygame Mixer

Description: This is a 2D arcade-style game built with Pygame. The player controls a character (moved with arrow keys) on an 800x600 screen to avoid "Grinch" enemies (which reduce health by 10 on collision) and collect "Elf" enemies (which add 10 to the score) and "cookie" items (which restore health to 100). The game features 8 enemies (60% Grinches, 40% Elves) and 1 cookie, all moving automatically with boundary bouncing. Background music and sound effects (e.g., attack and slurp sounds) enhance the experience. The score and health are displayed, and the game ends with a "GAME OVER!" message if health reaches 0. The game runs at 60 FPS for smooth gameplay.
